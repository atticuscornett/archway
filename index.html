        <h1>What is Archway?</h1>
        <p>
            Archway is a file automation tool that allows you to create jobs for archiving and backing up files on your computer.
            Archway makes repetitive tasks easy by allowing you to create jobs that can be run on a schedule or manually.
        </p>
        <h1>Why use Archway?</h1>
        <p>
            Archway is flexible and allows you to create powerful automation jobs that can save you time and effort.
            File filters allow you to specify which files to back up or archive, such as by file type, size, or last use date.
            From removing large videos from old projects to backing up important documents, Archway can help you manage your files efficiently.
            Archway makes moved files easy to find by maintaining the original folder structure in the archive/backup.
        </p>
        <h1>Is Archway lightweight?</h1>
        <p>
            Archway is built on Tauri, which is designed to be lightweight and efficient.
            The backend of Archway is written in Rust, so it is fast and uses minimal resources.
            A typical Archway installation is less than 20MB, and the application uses less than 10MB of RAM when idling in the background (may vary by system).
        </p>
        <h1>Is Archway open source?</h1>
        <p>
            Archway is totally open-source and free to use.
            Archway is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0, which means you can use, modify, and distribute it.
            The source code is available on GitHub and contributions are welcome.
